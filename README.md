# GOI
Game of Intelligence (GOI) is a quiz-style game inspired by Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC).
It challenges players through multiple stages of increasing difficulty â€” starting from quick aptitude riddles in the screening round.
Now, GOI also supports field-based quizzes(e.g., developer, marketing, finance, law, general). Players can choose their area of interest (e.g., developer, marketing, finance, law, general) and get stage-wise questions tailored to that field.

### Features
*	User Registration & Login â€“ simple auth system for players.
*	Screening Round â€“ solve 3 quick riddles to qualify.
*	Field Selection â€“ pick your area of interest before starting the game.
*	4 Stages of Gameplay â€“ difficulty increases with each stage.
*	Stage Progression â€“ one wrong answer ends the game, clear all to win.
*	Dynamic Question Selection â€“ random questions each game for variety.
*	Future-ready â€“ planned DB integration (PostgreSQL), frontend in FlutterFlow.

### Tech Stack
*	Backend: Python, FastAPI
